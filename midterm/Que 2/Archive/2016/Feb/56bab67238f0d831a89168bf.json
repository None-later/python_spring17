Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) mou-rns the passing of Howard Smith, former Board Chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and the United Hospital Fund, and the embodiment of volunteer leadership that defines health care in New York. Mr. Smith became Chair of Lutheran Hospital (now NYU Lutheran) in 1966, and drove its transformation into the principal health care provider in Southwest Brooklyn and the sponsor of the nation's largest hospital-based community health center, the Sunset Park Family Health Center. He also served on the Board of the United Hospital Fund for more than 25 years, including 19 as Chair. A lifelong Brooklynite-he was also Chair of the Brooklyn Public Library and its Foundation, and Vice-Chair of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and the Dime Savings Bank- Mr. Smith was unyielding in his commitment to ethics, tolerance, a more just world, and improving the health of all New Yorkers. We extend our deepest condolences to his children Howard Jr., Jean, and Lila, their spouses and children, and Howard's many friends and colleagues. Wendy Z. Goldstein, Chair, GNYHA Kenneth E.
