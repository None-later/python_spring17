We celebrate the life of Dollsey Gottfried Rappaport, sweet sister of Elissa Gottfried Epstein (Lovey), and aunt of Jill Epstein White, Mark Epstein, Debra Epstein and great-aunt to their children. Dollsey was above all an incredible mother to Nanette Rosenberg and Marjorie Rozman. Her wonderful grandchildren and great-grandchildren were the jewels of her life. She was amazing with them, and left a legacy of love of family and devotion to her religion. She was lucky to live to have great- grandchildren who lovingly called her GG. She got her wish to live long enough to welcome the family's newest addition Sammy, and knew another grandchild was on the way. She will also be remembered as a magnanimous philanthropist, and generous supporter of United Jewish Appeal and the State of Israel. Our parents Lola Mishkin Gottfried and Charles Gottfried were the inspiration of our family and are remembered now, as always. 1/3", "abstract": null, "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "print_page": "05", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E3DC163AF93BA35751C0A9609D8B63", "lead_paragraph": "RAPPAPORT--Dollsey G.
