{"slideshow_credits": null, "snippet": "JAHARIS--Michael. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Michael Jaharis, a treasured friend and generous Benefactor to the Museum with his wife Mary, an Honorary Trustee. Together they have been steadfast supporters of the Department of Greek and Roman Art and the Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters since 1984. Their multi-faceted giving has touched on many areas of the Met, from gifts of works of art to funds in support of acquisitions, capital projects, education initiatives, publications, and special exhibitions. In recognition of their generous contributions toward the masterplan for the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Galleries, the Museum's grand vaulted gallery for the display of classical art and the galleries for Byzantine art were designated the Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries. Michael was an unfailingly warm and committed member of the Met family, and he will be deeply missed. We offer our condolences to Mary and to the entire family. Daniel Brodsky, Chairman Thomas P.
