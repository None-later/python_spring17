When Morley recently visited us and walked into our new building for design, he maintained his robust gait and warm smile full of humor while mocking his need for a cane. His face lit up when he gazed upwards at the lighting fixture Josef Albers created for the Weimar Bauhaus. He declared it, and Anni Albers's colorful maquette for a synagogue arc curtain, two of the most surprising and splendid art works of the last century. \"Simply wonderful,\" he said, with his resonant voice and contagious enthusiasm. He held to his strong opinions about recent art, and revered what he admired with abiding passion. We send our deepest love to brilliant, beautiful Jane and the family he adored.
