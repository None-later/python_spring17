The Trustees and staff of The New York Public Library deeply mourn the passing of Barbara Goldsmith, a dedicated member of the Library family. She joined the Library's Board of Trustees in 1987 and was an active member for many years. She was a generous supporter and a strong advocate for preservation at the Library, where the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division bears her name. She served as a member of many key Board committees and on the Executive Committee of the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers. She was named a Life Trustee in 2006. An accomplished author, she was honored both as a Literary Lion and as a Centennial Lion. We offer our sincere sympathies to all of her family and friends. Evan R. Chesler, Chairman Samuel C.
