He was 92. Raised in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn in the 1920s-30s with his younger brother Herb, Sy attended James Madison High School and St. John's University, Business School and Law School. He served in the Army in Korea as a telegrapher. Sy became an attorney and a CPA and established Seymour Reich & Company, where he worked actively for 55 years until this past week. Sy was devoted to bridge, which he played weekly until his failing eyesight prevented it. He was an extremely affable man with a caring demeanor and a good sense of humor. He could be tenacious in pursuit of his goals, and at the same time kind and generous to those with whom he had dealings. He engendered, both in his employees and friends, a great sense of loyalty. He was deeply committed to philanthropy through The Reich Fund, which he established in the 1970s. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Lilian Reich, his son Charles and daughter-in-law Ilana, his daughter Elizabeth and son-in-law Stan, and his four grandchildren, Evie and Laura, and Audrey and Max, all of whom will miss him dearly. Funeral services at Frank E. Campbell, the Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, NYC, on Monday at 11:30am. Interment will follow at Temple Israel Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  REICH, SEYMOUR \"SY\""}, "_id": "579d6a5a38f0d84e50332733", "word_count": "241", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2016-07-23T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Classified", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "REICH, SEYMOUR \"SY\""}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice"}
