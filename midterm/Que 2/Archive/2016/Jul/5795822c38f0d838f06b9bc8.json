Beloved wife of the late Sherman S. Lawrence, Esq., loving and devoted mother of Robert L. Lawrence, Esq. and the late Alicia-Gayle Lawrence, adoring grandmother of Tara and Carly Lawrence. Florence was the most loving and devoted wife, mother, sister, grandmother, aunt and friend anybody could ever ask for. She was elegant, worldly, intelligent and a true lady in every respect. Florence lived life to the fullest and was a devoted and highly acclaimed teacher in the Garden City Public Schools for 33 years. She set the highest standards in living her life, which we should all strive to achieve. We are incredibly appreciative to Dalia for her dedication and loving care. Florence will be deeply missed.
