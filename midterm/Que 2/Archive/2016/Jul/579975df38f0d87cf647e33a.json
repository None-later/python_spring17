He was born of immigrant parents in Newark, NJ, where he graduated from Weequahic High School. Bright and ambitious, he graduated from the NYU School of Commerce while working during the day for his father and later graduated from the Fordham Law School. A member of the New York bar, he became a CPA, tax attorney, and partner with the New York accounting firm of David Berdon & Co. He and his beloved wife of 73 years, Phyllis, lived for many years in Roslyn, Long Island until their retirement to Sarasota 30 years ago. He was predeceased earlier this year by Phyllis and by a son, Eric. A wonderful father and grandfather, he is survived by daughter Peggy Northrop of Barrington, Rhode Island, son Peter Dworkin of San Francisco, five grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters. May the memory of the righteous be a blessing. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DWORKIN, ALBERT R."}, "_id": "579975df38f0d87cf647e33a", "word_count": "162", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2016-07-20T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Classified", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DWORKIN, ALBERT R."}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice"}
