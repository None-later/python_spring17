Baldev Duggal was made of eternal optimism. He saw opportunity where others saw none. \"If you don't have a dream, you have nothing,\" he often remarked. Baldev's dream was to leave the world better than he found it, and he went on to paint on a broader canvas. Baldev Duggal is survived by his three children: Susheila Kidman and husband Scott, Dave Duggal and wife Jennifer, Michael Duggal and wife Mollie. He is also survived by his eight grandchildren: Ryan, Brett and Lauren Kidman; Cyrus and Eloise Duggal; Faith, John Alexander and Christian Duggal; as well as his brother Sukhdev Duggal. A public memorial will be held on Wednesday, July 6th, 3:00pm at the Duggal Greenhouse located at 26 Navy Street (Building 268), Brooklyn, New York. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DUGGAL, BALDEV"}, "_id": "57830cac38f0d874e6b5a39d", "word_count": "166", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2016-07-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Classified", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DUGGAL, BALDEV"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice"}
