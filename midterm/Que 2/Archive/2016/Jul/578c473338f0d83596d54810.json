Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork- Presbyterian celebrate the life and mourn the passing of John R. Edsall, M.D., longtime pulmonologist and Clinical Professor of Medicine. His talent, expertise and compassion will long be remembered by his patients, by those who benefited from his tutelage, and from those fortunate to have known him as a colleague and friend. The John Edsall-John Wood Asthma Center in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine serves as an apt and enduring tribute to his life and work. We offer our condolences to his wife, Peggy; his children; and the extended Edsall family.
