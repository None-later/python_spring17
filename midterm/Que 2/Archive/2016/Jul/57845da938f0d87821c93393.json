The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of Elie Wiesel, Holocaust survivor, Nobel laureate and human rights advocate. He received an honorary degree from YU in 1973 and served as an honorary trustee of Yeshiva. He said, \"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.\" This is why he worked tirelessly to help ensure no one remained indifferent to injustice, that no one would ever forget. His life and contributions will be remembered and missed by the entire world. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife Marion and family. May they be comforted among all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M.
