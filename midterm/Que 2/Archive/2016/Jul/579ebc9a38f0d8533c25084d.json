Phyllis Bookey, 80, of NY, NY died July 16th in Ft. Lauderdale, FL with her beloved daughter Jamie by her side. She was an almost overly devoted grandmother to Harris and Gillian, a stern but loving mother-in-law to Joel, and brutally honest friend to many. A Hunter College graduate, Phyllis was a proud New Yorker who worked a career at NY Telephone/AT&T. She was predeceased by Irwin, her husband of 36 years, in 1996. Phyllis' final requests included this obituary in the New York Times and one last plea for people to stop acting like morons and start taking care of each other, which she always did. She will be sorely missed and dearly remembered. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BOOKEY, PHYLLIS"}, "_id": "579ebc9a38f0d8533c25084d", "word_count": "117", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2016-07-24T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Classified", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BOOKEY, PHYLLIS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice"}
