The board and staff of United Hospital Fund are deeply saddened by the loss of this extraordinary man and good friend, who provided wise counsel and strategic leadership for more than a decade as a valued member of our board and as the deeply respected chairman of our budget, audit, and operations committee. His careful stewardship was matched by his steadfast commitment to UHF's mission and the imperative of investing in new ideas and programs to build a more effective health care system for every New Yorker. He has left a strong imprint on our city and UHF, and will be greatly missed. J. Barclay Collins II Chairman James R.
