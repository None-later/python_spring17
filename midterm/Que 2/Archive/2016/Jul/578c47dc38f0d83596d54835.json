Died on June 23, 2016, at age 93. A trailblazer for women in science, Jerry earned a PhD in physical chemistry from Columbia in 1948, was a post-doctoral fellow at Sloan Kettering, and had a research career at IBM in thin films for semiconductor interconnections, receiving more than a dozen patents. She was one of the early women senior engineers at IBM and the first woman elected a Fellow of The Electrochemical Society. She grew up in Brooklyn and lived in Poughkeepsie for almost 60 years. Her husband, Robert S. Schwartz, died in 1964. They met as chemistry students at Brooklyn College and married after graduating in 1943. Jerry was known as a fine cook, and enjoyed tennis, classical music, and reading - especially mystery novels. She is survived by daughters Anne M. Schwartz and Frances Wheeler, sons-in-law Daniel Levitan and Tobin Wheeler, and grandchildren Rebecca and Abe Levitan and Gus and Archer Wheeler. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SCHWARTZ, GERALDINE C"}, "_id": "578c47dc38f0d83596d54835", "word_count": "157", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2016-07-10T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Classified", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SCHWARTZ, GERALDINE C"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice"}
