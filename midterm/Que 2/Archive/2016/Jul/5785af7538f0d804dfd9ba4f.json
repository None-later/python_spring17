Clal mourns the loss of our co-founder Elie Wiesel, a beacon of moral conscience, a passionate defender of both the Jewish people and of universal human dignity, and a visionary social architect who inspired and created institutions and texts which focused our attention on humankind's most important ethical questions, and helped us to answer those questions with greater efficacy and meaning. He was not only our co-founder, but our teacher and a genuine role model. May we continue to be inspired by the legacy he created in both words and deeds, and may his wife Marion, his son Elisha, his extended family, and all those who mourn the loss of this contemporary sage, find a place of comfort among those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem.
