On behalf of the Newark Academy Board of Trustees, administration and faculty, we express our deepest sympathies to the family of the Honorable Robert J. Del Tufo. During his time as a student at Newark Academy, Mr. Del Tufo left an indelible mark on the Academy. His many gifts, both academic and athletic, led the way for his esteemed career -- from lawyer to public servant. While a student at Newark Academy, Bob was three- sport athlete excelling in football, basketball and baseball. In addition, he served his fellow students as a member of the Student Council and on the staffs of the Academy's yearbook and school newspaper. Bob returned to his alma mater in 1977 as a member of the Newark Academy Board of Trustees, serving as Chairman of the Board from 1984 through 1987 and concluding his Board service in 2002. In 1981 Newark Academy honored Bob with its Alumni Achievement Award, recognizing his distinguished career as a public servant which included serving as a United States Attorney between 1977 and 1980 and being appointed Attorney General of New Jersey by Gov. James Florio in 1986. Bob will be deeply missed by his friends, classmates and fellow Trustees and his legacy of leadership at Newark Academy will be long remembered. 1/3", "abstract": null, "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "print_page": "28", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E2D6173AF930A25750C0A9609D8B63", "lead_paragraph": "DEL TUFO--Robert J.
