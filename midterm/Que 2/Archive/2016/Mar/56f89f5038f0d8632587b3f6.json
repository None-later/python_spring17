He spent many years in New York's garment district in different capacities, from gopher to buyer, merchandise manager, manufacturer, and shop owner. In his later years he went back to school and became a broker and Certified Financial Planner. When Jerry retired, he and his wife moved to Boynton Beach, FL where they lived for 10 years.
