We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anne Gerli, beloved member of The Skating Club of New York for over 80 years and US Figure Skating Hall of Fame recipient.

Her most memorable contributions were the establishment of the Junior National Championships and the Young Internationals program that in its first year sent future Olympic Champions Sarah Hughes and Evan Lysacek to compete internationally. Always the voice of reason and blending history while simplifying issues with wisdom and a wry sense of humor.
