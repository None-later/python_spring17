{"slideshow_credits": null, "snippet": "DIMON--Themis and Theodore. On June 5th and 6th, after battling cancer, Theodore \"Ted\" and Themis Dimon died peacefully at home surrounded by their devoted family. They were happily married for 65 years and are survived by Themis' sister, Olga; their children Peter, Ted Jr. and his wife Tamara, Jamie and his wife Judy; their grandchildren Julia and her husband Joey, Laura, Kara and her fiance, Conor; and their great grandchild Caroline. The second son of Panos Dimon (Papademitrou), an emigre from Smyrna, Turkey and Theonia Mylonas, Ted was born on January 3, 1931 and grew up in New York City. For 65 years, he developed a successful career as a top stock broker and financial advisor, mentoring many others in the business and building a first-rate team of partners who have been with him for many years. He also served as a Trustee on the Board of the St Luke's Orchestra Society and the School for Strings and provided pro bono financial advice to numerous non-profits. Themis Anastasia Kalos was born on August 26, 1931, the third daughter of Jimmy Kalos and Iphegnia Smyrnis, both emigres from the Greek Peloponnese. When her children left for college, Themis completed her Bachelor's degree at New School and earned her Master's degree in Psychology at Teachers College. Themis volunteered at a preschool program and served on several boards, including SCAN and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute Foundation. On June 5, Ted died in Themis's arms. Twenty two hours later Themis passed, on her own terms and by her own wish, together with Ted to the end -- a real love story. 1/3", "abstract": null, "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "print_page": "28", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E6DC103AF931A25755C0A9609D8B63", "lead_paragraph": "DIMON--Themis and Theodore.
