He was born in Philadelphia, PA on February 26, 1986 to Thomas B. O'Brien, Jr. and Federica F. O'Brien. Brennan graduated from Moorestown High School and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science from the University of Richmond. He was married to Allison Sottile on November 8, 2014 in Lake Placid, NY. Brennan took great pride in both his career and relationship with colleagues, working at Barclays Capital for six years within Structured Investments and most recently as an Executive Director at CIBC World Markets. His infectious love of life and competitive nature were a testament to his unrelenting spirit throughout his cancer battle, even taking part in Memorial Sloan Kettering's Cycle for Survival on his 30th birthday this past February to fundraise for rare cancer research. Brennan is survived by his loving wife Allison, his parents Tom and Freddi O'Brien and sister Alexandra Lunkenheimer. A celebration in honor of Brennan's life will be held at a future date for friends and family.
