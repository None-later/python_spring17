The only son of Marie and Theodore Weis, Ted was raised in New York and New Jersey. After graduating from Indiana University and Fordham University School of Law, he practiced as an entertainment attorney in his own firm and also worked with his wife in her clothing business. An easygoing, kind hearted and exceptionally funny man, Ted was happiest amongst his family and many longtime friends. He loved music, old monster movies, the Yankees and most of all, playing baseball and dodgeball with his daughter.
