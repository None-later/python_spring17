Arni was a gifted mathematician with a degree from New York University's Courant Institute.

He then changed direction for a career on Wall Street, doing risk arbitrage for several firms before starting his own boutique arbitrage firm, Amster & Company. He is survived by his wife Peggy Amster, daughter Wendy Amster, son-in-law David Hinkes, grandson Micah Hinkes, sister Loretta Nordon, nephew Mitchell Nordon, niece Ann Nordon, sister-in-law Linda Preuss and mother-in-law Gladys Preuss.
