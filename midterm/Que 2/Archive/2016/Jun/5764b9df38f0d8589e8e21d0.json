The Board and Staff of The New York Landmarks Conservancy mourn the passing, but celebrate the contributions, of our former Chair and longtime Board Member. Working with his great friend Brendan Gill, Donald was instrumental in early Conservancy preservation efforts. These include the fight to save the Biltmore Hotel, and successful efforts to save and preserve the Federal Archive Building, Peck Slip, the Fraunces Tavern Block and the Villard Houses. Donald was also close to the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, leading the Conservancy to embrace the Senator's goal of creating a great train station within the landmark Farley Post Office - an effort we continue to support. A consummate tactician, Donald urged the Conservancy to fight hard for preservation but to also work towards practical solutions, saying: \"Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\" We will always remain grateful for his leadership. Our condolences to his family. Lloyd P.
