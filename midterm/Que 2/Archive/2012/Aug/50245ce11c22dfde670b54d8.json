Once there Conner is drilled in company etiquette and ''stealth wealth'' -- what to wear, what to drive and which women to demean -- by a vulgar boss (Michael Park) and a sleazy colleague (Darren E. Scott) whose talents appear limited to crotch grabbing and coke snorting. No surprise then that Conner soon finds debauchery a significant distraction from deal making.", "headline": {"main": "$upercapitalist", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "50245ce11c22dfde670b54d8", "word_count": 258, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/10/arts/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/08/10/arts/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 257, "url": "images/2012/08/10/arts/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/08/10/arts/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN/10RDP_SUPERCAPSPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 257, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-08-09T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "$UPERCAPITALIST (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "SUPERCAPITALIST (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TING, DEREK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "YIN, SIMON"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
