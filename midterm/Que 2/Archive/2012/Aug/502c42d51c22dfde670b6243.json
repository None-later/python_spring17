It was inspired by her plan to write a book about an Eastern box turtle with wildflowers and ferns sprouting from its shell. In ''Mossy,'' due out next month (G. P. Putnam's Sons; $17.99), the turtle spends some unhappy months on display at a natural-history museum until a penitent biologist restores it to its habitat.Ms. Brett, 62, waited and waited for a turtle to move into her pond.
