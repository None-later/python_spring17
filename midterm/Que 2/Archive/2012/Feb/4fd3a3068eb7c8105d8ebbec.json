The theater has been under financial duress for a year. Last February it announced that it needed to raise $500,000 in a matter of weeks and another $250,000 by June and also in September to cover unpaid bills and unreported cost overruns and close other gaps. In April the rest of its 2011 season was canceled, the staff was laid off, and Kate Whoriskey left her post as the theater's artistic director.", "headline": {"main": "Intiman Theater in Seattle Will Stay Alive", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a3068eb7c8105d8ebbec", "word_count": 199, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-07T09:46:40Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Intiman Theater", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Whoriskey, Kate", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Seattle (Wash)", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
