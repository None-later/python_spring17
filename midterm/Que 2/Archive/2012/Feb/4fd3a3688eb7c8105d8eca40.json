Of all the inquiries - \"Where can I find swim trunks that aren't baggy?\" or \"Who makes a good belt?\" (Orlebar Brown and Billykirk, respectively) - there's one item that it seems everyone's looking for: pants \"that fit.\" Which is to say, one that's slim, but not too skinny; that can be worn to work and on the weekends. It's a tall order but Levi's just introduced a new style, the Sta-Prest chinos, that meets all the criteria. Available in four colors (khaki, grey, red and moss green), they're cut like your favorite jeans with a tapered leg, and a sharp, permanent front crease. After seasons of the ubiquitous distressed chinos (sometimes tea-stained, paint-splattered, ripped and shredded), the Levi's Sta-Prest is a welcome alternative.
