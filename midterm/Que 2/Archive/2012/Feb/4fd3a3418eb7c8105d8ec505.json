Embodied by Eddie Redmayne, the title character of Shakespeare's \"Richard II\" is seated, eyes closed, in full view of the audience before the start of Donmar Warehouse's production of Shakespeare's lyrical history play. And Richard might as well be a porcelain figurine -- exquisite, immobile, infinitely fragile. If someone were to tap him with the scepter he holds, he would surely shatter. God save the king indeed, you think, because he sure isn't up to saving himself.", "headline": {"main": "London Theater Journal: Porcelain Portrayal of a Fragile King", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a3418eb7c8105d8ec505", "word_count": 498, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-03T10:48:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Redmayne, Eddie", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kent, Richard", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Grandage, Michael", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Shakespeare, William", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Donmar Warehouse Theater", "rank": "7"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
