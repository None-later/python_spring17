Fully 68 percent of all ads that aired in the last week were attacks on Mr. Gingrich, according to Kantar Media Campaign Media Analysis Group, Jeremy Peters reported; 23 percent were attack ads against Mr. Romney. Among positive ads, 9 percent supported Mr. Gingrich and 0.1 percent supported Mr. Romney (a single ad, in Spanish, which showed Mr. Romney's son praising his father's leadership).", "headline": {"main": "The Breakfast Meeting: A Week of Negative Ads, and New Chief at Sony", "kicker": "Media Decoder"}, "_id": "4fd3a3878eb7c8105d8ecc95", "word_count": 421, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-01T08:44:48Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Amazon.com Inc", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Advertising and Marketing", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Primaries and Caucuses", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Stringer, Howard", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Gingrich, Newt", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Appointments and Executive Changes", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Boycotts", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Sony Corporation|SNE|NYSE", "rank": "14"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Computer and Video Games", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Amazon.com Inc|AMZN|NASDAQ", "rank": "13"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Electronics", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Presidential Election of 2012", "rank": "9"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Sony Corporation", "rank": "12"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
