It's been a long time since I studied statistics and probability (and maybe I never did, depending on how you define \"study\"), but it seems to me that this betting line is saying a few things.

Or third, if one team is trailing toward the end of the fourth quarter, it might well get a chance to kick a field goal to tie or win the game.
