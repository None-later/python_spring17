Hosted by John Demsey, the president of Este\u00e9 Lauder Cosmetics, and M.A.C., the intimate affair in the Waverly's fire-warmed back room was billed proudly as an opportunity for Gill and Adams to thank and honor the many stylish women who have inspired and supported their label over the years. Among those in attendance were Paper Magazine's Kim Hastreiter, the T contributor Lynn Yaeger, Cecilia Dean and Michelle Harper. The odd man out - and a delightful surprise to see at the room's elegant, ranunculus-full tables - was Antony Hegarty, the lead singer for Antony and the Johnsons. Calm and gracious (with less than two weeks before their fall 2012 runway showon Monday, Feb. 12 at Milk Studios), Gill and Adams gave guests an evening as refreshing and hip as their recent collections. \"Now, it's just about the details,\" said Gill about what's left to do before Fashion Week starts. Cheers to that.", "headline": {"main": "F\u00eate Accompli | Five and Counting", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a3768eb7c8105d8ecbc2", "word_count": 180, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-03T13:09:44Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Hastreiter, Kim", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Dean, Cecilia", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Adams, Alexa", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Hegarty, Antony", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Antony and the Johnsons", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Ohne Titel", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Waverly Inn & Garden", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
