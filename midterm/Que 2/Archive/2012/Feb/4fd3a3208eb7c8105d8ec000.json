Rules contest. She said that I was wrong to claim that the University of New Hampshire was sanctioned for allowing a track athlete to bring her three-month-old baby to a track meet. Instead, she wrote, the sanctions came about because the athlete was also allowed to bring her boyfriend to the meet. She added, \"Further, the N.C.A.A. national office was not even aware of the school's actions until two days later - it was neither our ruling nor our sanctions. As we shared with the school during our conversations at the time, the school's actions were stronger than required under N.C.A.A. guidelines; we would not have required her to miss any competitions.\"", "headline": {"main": "A Nocerablog Correction", "kicker": "Joe Nocera"}, "_id": "4fd3a3208eb7c8105d8ec000", "word_count": 433, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-02T13:20:06Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "College Athletics", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Amateur Athletics", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Boatright, Ryan", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "National Collegiate Athletic Assn", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "University of New Hampshire", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "New Hampshire", "rank": "7"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
