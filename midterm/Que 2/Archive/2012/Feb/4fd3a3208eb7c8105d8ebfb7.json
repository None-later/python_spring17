He was an eloquent proponent of a secular, democratic society, and was the strongest advocate for freedom and tolerance in the early modern period. The ultimate goal of his \"Theological-Political Treatise\" - published anonymously to great alarm in 1670, when it was called by one of its many critics \"a book forged in hell by the devil himself\"- is enshrined both in the book's subtitle and in the argument of its final chapter: to show that the \"freedom of philosophizing\" not only can be granted \"without detriment to public peace, to piety, and to the right of the sovereign, but also that it must be granted if these are to be preserved.\"", "headline": {"main": "Spinoza's Vision of Freedom, and Ours", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "_id": "4fd3a3208eb7c8105d8ebfb7", "word_count": 1956, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-05T17:30:29Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Censorship", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Supreme Court", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Spinoza, Baruch", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Holder, Eric H Jr", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Constitution (US)", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Freedom of Speech and Expression", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Philosophy", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Politics and Government", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Religion-State Relations", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
