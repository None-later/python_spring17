Washed in a super dry matte black or blue, the denim - milled by Cone, if you care - is all made from recycled or sustainable cotton, polyester and yarn in Raleigh's factory in North Carolina. \"Certain things can make you really happy - a good vanilla cupcake is one. A fun pair of jeans rolled up to the knee is another,\" Patrick says. Here, the Hip jean paired with a vegetable-dyed wool anorak, quilted vest and shrunken white shirt, which was our second favorite look from the show. Our first? A recycled double-face felted wool T-shirt paired with a silk shirt and hand-embroidered peasant skirt.", "headline": {"main": "Now Collaborating | Organic by John Patrick and Raleigh Denim", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a3418eb7c8105d8ec49f", "word_count": 154, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-08T16:34:46Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "unknown", "value": "Raleigh Denim", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Organic by John Patrick", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
