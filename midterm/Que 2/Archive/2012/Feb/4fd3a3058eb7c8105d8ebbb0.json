There, large groups of models styled to the hilt in clothes from the house's numerous men's-wear collections milled around highly detailed vignettes or stages, which lent the looks perfect contexts. Bearded mountain men in distressed shearlings and bright plaid and American Indian-inspired flannels with jeans and khakis tucked into boots looked perfectly at home in a roughly hewn mountain cabin. Across the way, an ersatz university club housed nattily suited gents in soft-shouldered tweed sack suits, all from the Polo Ralph Lauren line. Past a glass and steel ski lodge with a million-dollar mountain view, we got a look at the new Black Label Denim collection, in its second season now. The denim- and leather-heavy line had two distinct vibes: one \u00e0 la \"The Aviator,\" with a coated cotton bomber jacket, sleek knits and double breasted coats in olive and brown. The other, very Brando in \"The Wild One,\" was heavy on the leather with moto-inspired ribbed knits, short zipped jackets and slim utility jeans. My favorite look from this bunch was a short belted black leather jacket with asymmetrical zippers and intricately padded shoulders, shown with a front pant and biker boots. Slick, chic and utterly wearable.", "headline": {"main": "New York Top 5 | Ralph Lauren", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a3058eb7c8105d8ebbb0", "word_count": 213, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T17:32:38Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
