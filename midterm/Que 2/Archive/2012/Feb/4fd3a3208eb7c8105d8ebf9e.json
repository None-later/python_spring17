Bruce McCandless II and Col.l Robert L. Stewart, performed the first untethered spacewalk during the STS-41B mission. \"Free of any lifeline and propelled into the dark void by tiny jets, they became, in effect, the first human satellites, \" reported the Feb. 8 New York Times.Astronauts in every previous spacewalk, or extra-vehicular activity, had been attached to the spacecraft by a long cable. Captain McCandless and Colonel Stewart used 300-pound nitrogen-propelled backpacks known as manned maneuvering units to make their way through space. The men made two spacewalks during the mission, the second occurring on Feb. 9. The first lasted 5 hours 55 minutes and the second was 6 hours 17 minutes.", "headline": {"main": "Feb. 7, 1984 | NASA Astronauts Perform First Untethered Spacewalk", "kicker": "The Learning Network"}, "_id": "4fd3a3208eb7c8105d8ebf9e", "word_count": 424, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-07T04:02:50Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
