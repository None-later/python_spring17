Norse Projects turned Pro-Keds' Royal Master, originally released in 1972 and one of the brand's most recognizable styles, into something more refined, replacing the shoe's traditional canvas upper with premium suede and adding a tan leather heel tab and an inner sole made of natural cork. Available in mid-February, the Norse Projects for Pro-Keds sneaker comes in three colorways (navy, light gray and yellow), all inspired by elements that are synonymous with Copenhagen's picturesque landscape: the ocean, the beach and the old town.", "headline": {"main": "Now Collaborating | Norse Projects x Pro-Keds", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a3968eb7c8105d8ed195", "word_count": 129, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-01T10:54:51Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Keds Corp", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Sneakers", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
