But that has not deterred the Japanese government from starting to hand out an initial $13 billion in contracts meant to rehabilitate the more than 8,000-square-mile region, nearly 21,000 square kilometers, most exposed to radioactive fallout. And the government awarded the first contracts to three giant construction companies that profited hugely from Japan's previous embrace of nuclear power.
