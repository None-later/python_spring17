Ask most mustached bar wags what their favorite cocktail is and a strong percentage would cite either the Negroni or the Manhattan. No surprise there; these are bedrock classics that, even done haphazardly, are tastier than most everything else going. Ask those same self-anointed experts to make you a Boulevardier and a strong percentage might be left scratching their heads. I can't fathom why; the Boulevardier is a marvel of a cocktail with an enviably colorful peerage, and it's effectively the bastard child of those two other cocktails I mentioned. In these colder months, it's a magnificent drink to have as a fallback when you want something richer and more complex than just a whiskey but can never seem to think of what else to order.", "headline": {"main": "Case Study | The Boulevardier", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a3338eb7c8105d8ec26d", "word_count": 1000, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-02T09:00:11Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
