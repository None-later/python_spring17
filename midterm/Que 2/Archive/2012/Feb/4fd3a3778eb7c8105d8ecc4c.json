CBS drew the most viewers over all. An average of 17.9 million people watched \"Idol,\" barely beating last week's total of 17.4 million but the show was also up 4 percent in the 18-to-49 category. Again, not a large gain, but a change from the downward trend that followed earlier episodes.", "headline": {"main": "A Ratings Uptick for 'Idol'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a3778eb7c8105d8ecc4c", "word_count": 129, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-10T16:13:12Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "unknown", "value": "CBS Corporation|CBS|NYSE", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CBS Corporation", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Television", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
