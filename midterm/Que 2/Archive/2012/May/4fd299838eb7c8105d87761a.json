It started running here this week near the estate where Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt lived and where the modern presidency began to take shape. The ride isn't something radical. It is not a roller coaster veering through simulated landscapes of the Depression or coursing over virtual World War II battlefields. It doesn't rely on high-tech innovations to make the intricacies of the New Deal more palpable. It feels commonplace, scarcely worth noticing. The Roosevelt Ride is a free shuttle bus.", "headline": {"main": "Next Stop, Modern Presidency", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d87761a", "word_count": 1374, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FDR_SPAN/04FDR_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FDR_SPAN/04FDR_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 372, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FDR_SPAN/04FDR_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FDR_SPAN/04FDR_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 372, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ROOSEVELT, ELEANOR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROOSEVELT, FRANKLIN DELANO"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "HYDE PARK (NY)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ROOSEVELT, FRANKLIN D, PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL PARK SERVICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTS AND PRESIDENCY (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PARKS AND OTHER RECREATION AREAS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
