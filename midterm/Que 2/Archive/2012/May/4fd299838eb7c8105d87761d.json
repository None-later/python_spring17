It centers on Eva Markvoort, who in her early 20s is hoping for a double lung transplant while battling the disease, which is characterized by a life-threatening buildup of mucus. The film, Thursday night on OWN, is not at all shy about showing the hopes and setbacks of Ms. Markvoort and her family, but unlike some other documentaries in this genre it doesn't feel exploitive. Instead it's illuminating and, despite the subject matter, oddly uplifting.", "headline": {"main": "Blogging A Path Through Illness", "kicker": "TELEVISION REVIEW | '65--REDROSES'"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d87761d", "word_count": 582, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/sub-03roses/sub-03roses-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/arts/sub-03roses/sub-03roses-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Television", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "65_REDROSES (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "65--REDROSES (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CYSTIC FIBROSIS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
