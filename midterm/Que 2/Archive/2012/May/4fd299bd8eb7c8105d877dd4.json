But they sure don't hurt its chances. That's certainly true in ''The Runner Stumbles,'' a drama that surmounts more than a few problems to become quite an absorbing show. Set in 1911 and based loosely on real events, the story centers on Father Rivard (Christopher Patrick Mullen), a disheartened small-town priest who finds himself drawn to Sister Rita (Casandera M. J. Lollar), a new nun at his ailing parish. Their relationship becomes a source of gossip, and when Sister Rita is later found dead, Father Rivard is the prime suspect.", "headline": {"main": "A Forbidden Attraction Is Just the Beginning", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd299bd8eb7c8105d877dd4", "word_count": 323, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/arts/runner/runner-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/arts/runner/runner-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE RUNNER STUMBLES (PLAY)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "RUNNER STUMBLES, THE (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ZINN, PETER"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STITT, MILAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MULLEN, CHRISTOPHER PATRICK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
