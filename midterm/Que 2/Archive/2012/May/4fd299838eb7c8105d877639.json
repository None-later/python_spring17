Each year, this prominent competition hands out both actual contracts and more than a quarter of a million dollars in scholarships to dance schools. Soloists, 9 to 19, from Australia to Ukraine have up to two and a half minutes (ensembles have up to six) to wow the judges and perhaps change their lives. In ''First Position,'' they have 94 minutes to win you over, first as a group as seemingly alike as the cygnets in ''Swan Lake,'' and later as stars.", "headline": {"main": "Tracking Ballet's Pull On Youth Worldwide", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d877639", "word_count": 923, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FIRST/FIRST-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FIRST/FIRST-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FIRST/FIRST-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04FIRST/FIRST-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FIRST POSITION (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KARGMAN, BESS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
