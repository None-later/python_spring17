One answer, written by a redshirt junior named Demario Davis, struck Wommack as particularly memorable: Davis vowed that the Red Wolves' defense would finish among the top 25. Davis did not forget. In spring practice, he would visit Wommack's office to tell him again. In training camp, he restated his guarantee. But during the season, Davis, an outside linebacker, recalibrated his expectations. He told Wommack that they needed to adjust their goals. They were not high enough. At the time, the defense ranked 22nd in the nation. It finished 15th.", "headline": {"main": "A Leader From the Start"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d8776b9", "word_count": 926, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/SUB-jets/SUB-jets-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/sports/SUB-jets/SUB-jets-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Pro Football", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DAVIS, DEMARIO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WOMMACK, DAVE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK JETS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRAFT AND RECRUITMENT (SPORTS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOTBALL"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
