Seeing it will also be a jolt for those who have forgotten the world of bitterness into which it was born. Most of the film is music and motion and commotion: Ladysmith Black Mambazo high-stepping and smooth-crooning, the guitarist Ray Phiri doing his swivel-hip thing, drums and bass pulsing under Mr. Simon's rolling, tumbling New-York-surreal lyrics. People singing and swaying at huge open-air concerts in London and Lesotho. Others marching and getting beaten in Johannesburg. Penny whistles and accordions. Billy clubs and tear gas.", "headline": {"main": "Back to 'Graceland' After 25 Years", "kicker": "EDITORIAL | SUNDAY OBSERVER"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d87769e", "word_count": 863, "multimedia": [{"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sunday-review/editorial/editorial-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/sunday-review/editorial/editorial-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Opinion / Sunday Review", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "UNDER AFRICAN SKIES (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SIMON, PAUL"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SOUTH AFRICA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APARTHEID (POLICY)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial"}
