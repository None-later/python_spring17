One could take a wrong turn, go down the wrong path. ''And,'' he always ended his admonitions, ''end up like your cousin, Barney.'' My father warned me about Barney the way fathers in fairy tales warn their children about paths that lead to the edge of a cliff or wolves that might wish to befriend us. Barney, born Barnet Lee Rosset Jr., was, in my father's eyes, the black sheep of the family. The renegade, the ne'er-do-well, the ungrateful son. He'd purchased a failing publishing company called Grove Press. He was squandering his father's fortune. He was a Communist and a pornographer. Growing up, I actually never knew my cousin Barney. Our grandmothers were sisters, and after Barnet Sr.'s mother died when he was just a boy, my grandmother took him in, raising him and my father as brothers. Then Barnet Sr. left the fold: he married young, to an Irish woman, causing a huge scandal in our Jewish household.", "headline": {"main": "Black Sheep", "kicker": "ESSAY"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d87764e", "word_count": 1335, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/books/review/06MORRIS/06MORRIS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/books/review/06MORRIS/06MORRIS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Books / Sunday Book Review", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ROSSET, BARNEY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "GROVE PRESS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOK TRADE AND PUBLISHING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
