The man, Ampon Tangnoppakul, 61, was sentenced in November to five years for each of four text messages sent from his mobile phone. The court did not reveal the content of the messages but said they went against the ''evident'' fact that King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit ''are full of mercy and concerned about the entire population'' and could incite hatred of the rulers.", "headline": {"main": "Thailand: Man Convicted of Insulting Monarchy in Text Messages Dies in Jail"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d87771e", "word_count": 436, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/world/asia/09thailand_1/09thailand_1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/world/asia/09thailand_1/09thailand_1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Asia Pacific", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SIRIKIT, QUEEN OF THAILAND"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "AMPON TANGNOPPAKUL"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "THAILAND"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SENTENCES (CRIMINAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROYAL FAMILY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TEXT MESSAGING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
