Mr. Romney's record of cutting and outsourcing jobs as a businessman and Massachusetts governor, the ad charges, ''is just what you'd expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account.'' The Obama ad will run in three battleground states -- Ohio, Virginia and Iowa -- where the anti-Obama ad has also appeared. THE SCRIPT The ad begins with a man's emphatic voice reading quotes that appear on screen -- ''over the top,'' ''erroneous,'' ''out of context'' -- to describe the anti-Obama ad. The narrator counters, ''President Obama's clean energy initiatives have helped create jobs for projects across America, not overseas.'' The narrator quickly asks, ''What about Mitt Romney?'' and answers, ''As a corporate C.E.O., he shipped American jobs to places like Mexico and China. As governor, he outsourced state jobs to a call center in India. He's still pushing tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.'' The ad ends with the line about the Swiss bank account.", "headline": {"main": "Obama Spot Offers a Rebuttal and a Jab at Romney", "kicker": "AD WATCH"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d8775d1", "word_count": 522, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S. / Politics", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OBAMA, BARACK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROMNEY, MITT"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN FUTURE FUND"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BAIN CAPITAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICAL ADVERTISING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABOR AND JOBS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
