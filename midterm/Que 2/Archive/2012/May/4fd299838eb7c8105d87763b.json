He's having what appears to be a pretty good seafaring time clomping around on one-and-a-half legs in ''Treasure Island,'' a new, four-hour version of Robert Louis Stevenson's find-the-gold story being broadcast Saturday on Syfy. Mr. Izzard plays Long John Silver in standard pirate clothes, but purists may hate this movie as much as if he were doing the role in drag. The adaptation, written by Stewart Harcourt and directed by Steve Barron, takes liberties with Stevenson's tale that some will find unforgivable. But viewers open to experimentation will enjoy simply seeing if they agree with the choices the filmmakers made in their what-if game. And Mr. Izzard, adorned with a head tattoo, is a treat throughout.", "headline": {"main": "Sifting Through Evil In a Hunt for Buried Gold", "kicker": "TELEVISION REVIEW | 'TREASURE ISLAND'"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d87763b", "word_count": 739, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/TREASURE/TREASURE-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/arts/TREASURE/TREASURE-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 380, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/TREASURE/TREASURE-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/05/arts/TREASURE/TREASURE-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 380, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Television", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "TREASURE ISLAND (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STEVENSON, ROBERT LOUIS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BARRON, STEVEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HARCOURT, STEWART"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "REGBO, TOBY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "IZZARD, EDDIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HALMI, ROBERT SR"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SYFY CHANNEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
