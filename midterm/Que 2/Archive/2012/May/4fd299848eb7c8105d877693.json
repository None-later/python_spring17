Elias has won it all twice, so he has developed a good sense of timing. And this, he decided, was not quite the right moment to shoot the puck. So, with the Devils on a power play and trailing Philadelphia by a goal, Elias held the puck just long enough to size up Flyers goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov one more time. Elias shot across ice, across Bryzgalov's big body. The puck hit Bryzgalov's blocker and dropped in the goal.", "headline": {"main": "Elias Steadies Devils in the Postseason's Tumult"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d877693", "word_count": 854, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Hockey", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ELIAS, PATRIK"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PHILADELPHIA FLYERS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW JERSEY DEVILS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOCKEY, ICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PLAYOFF GAMES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
