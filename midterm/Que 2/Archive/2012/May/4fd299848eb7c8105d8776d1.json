L. Doctorow novel about Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's victorious sweep through Georgia and the Carolinas during the latter days of the Civil War. The unmistakable wheeze of a sleeping patron is not unheard of at the theater, certainly, but never before have I felt envious of the fellow drifting off to dreamland. Mr. Doctorow's 2005 book, a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and a finalist for two of the biggest trophies of the literary world -- the Pulitzer and the National Book Award -- is a marvelous achievement, a historical novel that favors intimate detail over muscular narrative. Through the experience of a dozen or so central characters Mr. Doctorow brings alive the chaos and waste and even some of the glory of the Civil War, but also the vagaries of chance and the idiosyncrasies of character that allow some to thrive in the charnel house of battle while others are defeated or destroyed.", "headline": {"main": "The Slog to the Sea, Accompanied by Speeches of Unlikely Eloquence", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d8776d1", "word_count": 1187, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/MARCH/MARCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/arts/MARCH/MARCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE MARCH (PLAY)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "MARCH, THE (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GALATI, FRANK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SHERMAN, WILLIAM TECUMSEH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DOCTOROW, E L"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CHICAGO (ILL)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "STEPPENWOLF THEATRE CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CIVIL WAR (US) (1861-65)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
