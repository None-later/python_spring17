For a young lawyer, a job at any of them was the first step to the golden ring of partnership and, with it, lifetime tenure, prestige and affluence. Maybe that's why the seemingly inevitable collapse of a firm like Dewey, since renamed Dewey & LeBoeuf as a result of a 2007 merger, has so rocked the legal profession. Dewey is hardly the first major law firm to fail. Recent years have seen the demise of once-respected names like Howrey & Simon; Coudert Brothers; Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison; and Heller Ehrman. But none had the pedigree of Dewey, named for the former New York governor and presidential candidate Thomas E.
