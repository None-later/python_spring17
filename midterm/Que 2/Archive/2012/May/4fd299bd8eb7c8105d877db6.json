But there are a couple of horsemen here who would have preferred that Parbhoo had skipped the race. Even though Trinniberg is 50-1 on the morning line, he may have a powerful say on how the race will be run and who will be its winner.", "headline": {"main": "Contenders Will Have to Adjust to a Long Shot's All-Out Style"}, "_id": "4fd299bd8eb7c8105d877db6", "word_count": 875, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/sports/05racing_337/05racing_337-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/sports/05racing_337/05racing_337-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "HORSE RACING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "KENTUCKY DERBY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRINNIBERG (RACE HORSE)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
