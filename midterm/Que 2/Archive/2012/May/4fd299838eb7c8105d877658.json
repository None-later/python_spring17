While depression is no picnic, it is part of the richness that encompasses the human condition, something we seem to be forgetting in this nation obsessed with happiness. I'm not advocating that people who are suffering should continue to do so. I am merely suggesting that the cure be as complex as the disease. Prescribing a pill, and nothing else, to people who question their existence is unlikely to heal them of their overwhelming sorrow.", "headline": {"main": "The 4.22.12 Issue", "kicker": "REPLY ALL | LETTERS"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d877658", "word_count": 1591, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BRAIN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INTELLIGENCE (IQ)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EXERCISE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGISTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTIDEPRESSANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEPRESSION (MENTAL)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
