It also seems to be the philosophy at Blue Smoke, the barbecue restaurants owned by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group, which have taken 10 years to come up with a new sauce to slather on their pork. Unlike the company's all-purpose Original Recipe BBQ Sauce, with its fairly mild ketchup and mustard base, the tangy newcomer, Blue Smoke Carolina Kick Barbecue Sauce, can run roughshod over a pile of pulled pork, giving it a robust new personality. ''We try to represent all the barbecue regions in the country -- Kansas City, Texas, Memphis -- and we wanted the Carolinas, too,'' said Kenny Callaghan, the chef and pit-master. The sauce is a typical vinegar-based North Carolina blend, well dappled with bits of spice, which the restaurants now serve on the pulled pork. ''The pork is somewhat fatty, so it can take the spice and vinegar,'' Mr. Callaghan said. ''But if someone prefers the other sauce, they can still get it on the pork.'' And if someone buys the new sauce to take home, it can do wonders for a slab of fish, a flank steak or lamb chops on the grill.", "headline": {"main": "A Taste of North Carolina, at Last", "kicker": "FOOD STUFF"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d8775fe", "word_count": 249, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/dining/02STUFF_BBQ/02STUFF_BBQ-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/dining/02STUFF_BBQ/02STUFF_BBQ-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SAUCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BARBECUE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
