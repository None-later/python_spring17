Benedict Cumberbatch, who is back for a new season as Holmes on Sunday on PBS's ''Masterpiece Mystery!,'' is getting so good at his quirky portrayal that the crimes Holmes is solving are a secondary concern. Mr. Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Watson are just plain enjoyable to watch. It's all about repartee for these two; theirs is quick and sharp and often comes at the most incongruous moments. In the ''Sherlock'' season premiere Watson is giving the absent Holmes a view of a crime scene via video hookup, but Holmes is proving to be just as annoying on a laptop as he is in person.", "headline": {"main": "Holmes and Watson, Back to Bantering", "kicker": "TELEVISION REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d877643", "word_count": 433, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/SHERLOCK/SHERLOCK-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/arts/SHERLOCK/SHERLOCK-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/SHERLOCK/SHERLOCK-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/05/arts/SHERLOCK/SHERLOCK-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Television", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SHERLOCK (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "MASTERPIECE MYSTERY!
