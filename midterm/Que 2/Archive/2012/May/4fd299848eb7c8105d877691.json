A video recounting Mr. Bo's ''smash black'' crackdown on organized crime featured mug shots of gangsters emblazoned on tombstones. Maoist revolutionary songs blared from speakers in the ''red culture'' wing. Lasers zipped across the ''honest government'' gallery. But in February, two days after Mr. Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in an American consulate, apparently with evidence of a murder plot hatched by Mr. Bo's wife, the ''smash black'' exhibit shut its doors. The remaining galleries were closed last month after Mr. Bo was removed from his Communist Party posts in a widening corruption scandal that is roiling the Chinese government.
