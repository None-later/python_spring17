The Dutch marketing consultant, who was abducted last year in South Africa, kept calm in captivity, he recalled, until a gun was put to his head. Mr. de Ronde then asked himself, ''What will they say at my funeral?''

The trading company asked Mr. de Ronde, in the Netherlands, to meet with the sellers in Johannesburg.
