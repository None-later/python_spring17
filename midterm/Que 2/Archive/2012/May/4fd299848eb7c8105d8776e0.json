Rangel, was endorsed on Monday by one of the city's most prominent Hispanic leaders, Fernando Ferrer. Mr. Espaillat is the most prominent of several Democratic challengers to Mr. Rangel, a veteran Harlem congressman whose bid for re-election has been complicated this year by redistricting, which transformed the area, long a center of black political power, into a district with a Hispanic majority. Mr. Espaillat is Dominican-American and would be the first Dominican-born person to serve in Congress; the district now includes part of the Bronx and is known as the 13th Congressional District.", "headline": {"main": "A Prominent Endorsement For a Challenger to Rangel"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d8776e0", "word_count": 513, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/RANGEL/RANGEL-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/RANGEL/RANGEL-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/RANGEL/RANGEL-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/RANGEL/RANGEL-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "RANGEL, CHARLES B"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FERRER, FERNANDO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ESPAILLAT, ADRIANO"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ENDORSEMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
