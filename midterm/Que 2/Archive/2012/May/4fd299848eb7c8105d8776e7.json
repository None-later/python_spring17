But recently Yale students who like to sing and prefer learning by doing have had a more tantalizing option: They can try out for Ms. Rosand's course Analyzing, Directing and Performing Early Opera, in which the class assignment each semester is to put on a fully staged production of a selected Baroque work. The class is part of the Yale Baroque Opera Project, which Ms. Rosand founded five years ago with funds from the Mellon Foundation. Though the project offers specialized classes in continuo realization and such, its focus has been staged productions of operas featuring casts of undergraduates accompanied by period ensembles of faculty, student and guest players. The first complete opera was Monteverdi's ''Orfeo,'' which got things going in 2008. Since then rarities by Cavalli and Sacrati and a Handel pastiche have been staged.", "headline": {"main": "Ulysses Goes to College, in a Lively Monteverdi", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d8776e7", "word_count": 766, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/ritorno/ritorno-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/arts/ritorno/ritorno-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/ritorno/ritorno-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/arts/ritorno/ritorno-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "IL RITORNO D'ULISSE IN PATRIA (OPERA)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MONTEVERDI, CLAUDIO"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW HAVEN (CONN)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YALE UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OPERA"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
