That is what happened at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge on Tuesday to a surprisingly self-possessed osprey, a once-threatened bird of prey whose comeback since the 1970s has made it a symbol of ecological recovery. While biologists have long attached simple color bands to birds' legs, the amount of data they get back has been limited -- and often they do not get information until the bird has died. But in the past few years, Global Positioning System tags have gained in popularity, allowing wildlife managers and the public to track a bird's daily movements and long-distance migrations. The transmitter conveys a bird's exact location, altitude, speed and direction at any moment.", "headline": {"main": "An Earth-Bound View Of Where Ospreys Soar"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d8775e9", "word_count": 755, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/nyregion/OSPREY2/OSPREY2-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/nyregion/OSPREY2/OSPREY2-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 340, "url": "images/2012/05/02/nyregion/OSPREY1/OSPREY1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/02/nyregion/OSPREY1/OSPREY1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 340, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "KENNEDY, BOB"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RIEPE, DON"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "JAMAICA BAY WILDLIFE REFUGE (NYC)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "JAMAICA BAY (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN LITTORAL SOCIETY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL PARKS OF NEW YORK HARBOR CONSERVANCY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL PARK SERVICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NAVIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OSPREYS (BIRDS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ENDANGERED AND EXTINCT SPECIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PARKS AND OTHER RECREATION AREAS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
