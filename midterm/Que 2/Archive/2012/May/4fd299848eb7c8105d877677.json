They founded Hargrave Vineyard and helped start an industry that has transformed the North Fork of Long Island, which is home today to nearly 50 vineyards and wineries. ''To me, Cutchogue is the heart of the agricultural North Fork,'' said Ms. Hargrave, now a wine consultant and columnist, and a real estate agent. ''People come because of an appreciation for its rural character. I love the water, the sunshine, the farmland and the light. Because of the refraction from the sea, you can get a kind of enchanted light.''", "headline": {"main": "A Summer Place, Magnetic Year-Round", "kicker": "LIVING IN | CUTCHOGUE, L.I."}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d877677", "word_count": 1605, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06LIVINGIN_SPAN/06LIVINGIN_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06LIVINGIN_SPAN/06LIVINGIN_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06LIVINGIN_SPAN/06LIVINGIN_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06LIVINGIN_SPAN/06LIVINGIN_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Real Estate", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "CUTCHOGUE (NY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REAL ESTATE AND HOUSING (RESIDENTIAL)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
