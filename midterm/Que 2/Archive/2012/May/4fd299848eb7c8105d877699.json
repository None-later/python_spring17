Its spring season, which began on Tuesday, brought 12 ballets into repertory by Saturday night, going all the way back to 1934 (George Balanchine's ''Serenade''), and up to 2006 (Christopher Wheeldon's ''DGV: Danse \u00e0 Grande Vitesse''). Next week's additions include two world premieres. This abundance, phenomenal elsewhere, is ordinary at City Ballet. There are other ways to take in ballet, though: for example, by concentrating on dancers, on dancing (not necessarily the same thing), on history and on music. Wednesday night's performance began with one of the company's rightly popular See the Music talks, in which the conductor Andrews Sill spoke of Tchaikovsky's ''Serenade for Strings'' and of Balanchine's structural reordering of it in ''Serenade.'' (The third movement is played after the fourth.) He also paid a touching personal tribute to the conductor Hugo Fiorato, who died last month. For decades Mr. Fiorato was a constant part of City Ballet's existence and gave many performances a particular warmth.", "headline": {"main": "One Week's Journey Through a Whole Century in Ballet", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d877699", "word_count": 1159, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/arts/nycb/nycb-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/arts/nycb/nycb-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Dance", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY BALLET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
