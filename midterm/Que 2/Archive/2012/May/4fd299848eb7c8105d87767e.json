It may not even look like a slowdown because by developed standards, India's growth -- estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 6.9 percent for 2012 -- is still strong. But a slowdown it is: the economy has decelerated from projected rates of more than 8 percent, and negative momentum may bring a further decline. The government reported year-over-year growth in the October-through-December quarter of only 6.1 percent.", "headline": {"main": "Never Mind Europe.
