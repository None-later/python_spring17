The university, whose nonprofit status exempts it from paying taxes, will pay the city $31.5 million over 11 years, in addition to the annual amount it already pays under a 2003 agreement, which this year was about $4 million. Mayor Angel Taveras has pressured all of the city's tax-exempt institutions to contribute more to city coffers. On Monday, the nonprofit Lifespan hospital group agreed to pay Providence an additional $2.4 million a year; Johnson & Wales University has also agreed to increase its voluntary payments. In February, Mr. Taveras said the city would run out of money in June if, among another measures, it could not get higher payments from tax-exempt institutions and decrease its pension obligations.", "headline": {"main": "Rhode Island: Brown To Increase Pay To Providence", "kicker": "NATIONAL BRIEFING | NEW ENGLAND"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d8775df", "word_count": 150, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "PROVIDENCE (RI)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BROWN UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BANKRUPTCIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
