It was their first time on the ice since they won Game 3 in the wee hours of Thursday morning, after 114 minutes 41 seconds of sweat-drenched, bone-rattling, muscle-burning hockey. ''I feel fine,'' said the skater who played the most in a 2-1 win over Washington in triple overtime, defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who compiled 53:17 of ice time. ''I don't think there's really any hangover. We were happy about the outcome. Yesterday was kind of our day to soak it in and enjoy it. Today we move by it and get ready for tomorrow.''", "headline": {"main": "A Day Off Recharges The Weary Rangers"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d877665", "word_count": 783, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Hockey", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MCDONAGH, RYAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TORTORELLA, JOHN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK RANGERS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WASHINGTON CAPITALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOCKEY, ICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PLAYOFF GAMES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
