He triumphed in a daunting program, playing all three sets of Chopin's \u00e9tudes. Mr. Pollini is once again ailing. Health issues have caused him to cancel a series of engagements in the United States, including two solo recitals at Carnegie. On April 29, Garrick Ohlsson stepped in for the first, and on Sunday afternoon, almost exactly nine years after the last time, Mr. Lortie again did the honors.", "headline": {"main": "A Substitute Adept at Rounding Hairpin Turns", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d87771d", "word_count": 416, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/LOUIS/LOUIS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/arts/LOUIS/LOUIS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "POLLINI, MAURIZIO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LORTIE, LOUIS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CLASSICAL MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
