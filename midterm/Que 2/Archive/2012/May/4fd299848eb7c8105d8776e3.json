Putin's third inauguration as president. Sunday's demonstration, a day before the inauguration, drew at least 20,000 people, organizers and news outlets said. It began peacefully with a marching band and Muscovites waving placards lampooning Mr. Putin and his government. But the situation became chaotic when protesters tried to break through a column of riot police officers in an apparent effort to reach the Kremlin.", "headline": {"main": "Arrests and Violence at Overflowing Rally in Moscow"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d8776e3", "word_count": 937, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/world/07russia/07russia-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/world/07russia/07russia-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/07/world/07russia/07russia-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/07/world/07russia/07russia-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Europe", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "NAVALNY, ALEKSEI N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "UDALTSOV, SERGEI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PUTIN, VLADIMIR V"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "RUSSIA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "MOSCOW (RUSSIA)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS, AND RIOTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
