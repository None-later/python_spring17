The pending changes reflect an effort by the Army's top officer, Gen. Ray Odierno, to institutionalize many of the successful tactics adopted ad hoc in Afghanistan and Iraq. As the Army shrinks by 80,000 troops over the next five years, General Odierno is seeking ways to assure that it is prepared for a broader set of missions, including in hot spots around the world where few soldiers have deployed in the past.", "headline": {"main": "Reshaped Military Will Bridge the Gap Between Special and Conventional Forces"}, "_id": "4fd299838eb7c8105d8775f5", "word_count": 972, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S. / Politics", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ODIERNO, RAYMOND T"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AFGHANISTAN WAR (2001- )"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "IRAQ WAR (2003-11)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
