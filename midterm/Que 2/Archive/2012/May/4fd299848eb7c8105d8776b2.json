Thousands of readers submitted essays, and thousands more voted on the finalists that we posted online. Our panel of judges -- Mark Bittman, Jonathan Safran Foer, Andrew Light, Michael Pollan and Peter Singer -- chose the essay below as the winner. It will be published in the May 6 issue of the magazine. As a vegetarian who returned to meat-eating, I find the question ''Is meat-eating ethical?'' one that is in my head and heart constantly. The reasons I became a vegetarian, then a vegan and then again a conscientious meat-eater were all ethical. The ethical reasons of why NOT to eat meat are obvious: animals are raised and killed in cruel conditions; grain that could feed hungry people is fed to animals; the need for pasture fuels deforestation; and by eating meat, one is implicated in the killing of a sentient being. Except for the last reason, however, none of these aspects of eating meat are implicit in eating meat, yet they are exactly what make eating some meat unethical. Which leads to my main argument: eating meat raised in specific circumstances is ethical; eating meat raised in other circumstances is unethical. Just as eating vegetables, tofu or grain raised in certain circumstances is ethical and those produced in other ways is unethical.", "headline": {"main": "Jay Bost", "kicker": "THE WINNER"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d8776b2", "word_count": 754, "multimedia": [{"height": 200, "url": "images/2012/05/02/magazine/ethicist-winner-span/ethicist-winner-span-articleLarge.png", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/02/magazine/ethicist-winner-span/ethicist-winner-span-articleLarge.png", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 200, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS (PERSONAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VEGETARIANISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FACTORY FARMING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEAT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICIST, THE (TIMES COLUMN)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Question"}
