''But seeing that show every afternoon, at home, in Burbank, it just doesn't get much weirder than that.'' And for Mr. Burton, the director of ''Edward Scissorhands,'' ''Sleepy Hollow,'' and now a splashy silver-screen ''Dark Shadows'' (opening Friday), ''weird'' is a term of the very highest praise.", "headline": {"main": "The Vampire Who Came Out In the Afternoon", "kicker": "TELEVISION"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d87767b", "word_count": 1198, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06SHADOWS1_SPAN/06SHADOWS1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06SHADOWS1_SPAN/06SHADOWS1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06SHADOWS1_SPAN/06SHADOWS1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06SHADOWS1_SPAN/06SHADOWS1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Television", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "DARK SHADOWS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "DARK SHADOWS (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BURTON, TIM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CURTIS, DAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
