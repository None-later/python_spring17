Until this year, that would have been Bespoke, a contemporary Mediterranean restaurant. But this spring, you'll be eating mezze at its new incarnation, Gilt Moroccan Steakhouse and Lounge. Gilt's chef and owner, Lauren Kendzierski, bought Bespoke in 2010 from New Haven restaurateurs Arturo and Suzette Franco-Comacho. She reopened it in February as Gilt, serving what she described, in a recent phone conversation, as modern Moroccan cuisine.", "headline": {"main": "Rooftop Cuisine, Reincarnated", "kicker": "CONNECTICUT DINING | NEW HAVEN"}, "_id": "4fd299848eb7c8105d877695", "word_count": 1017, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINECT1/06DINECT1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINECT1/06DINECT1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINECT2_SPAN/06SUBDINECT2-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINECT2_SPAN/06SUBDINECT2-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW HAVEN (CONN)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "GILT MOROCCAN STEAKHOUSE AND LOUNGE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
