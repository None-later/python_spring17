Chen, technology reporter for The Times, writes in an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/technology/nook-from-barnes-noble-gains-more-e-book-readers.html\">accompanying article</a> that the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" class=\"tickerized\" title=\"More information about Apple Incorporated\">Apple</a> <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/ipad/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" class=\"tickerized\" title=\"More articles about iPad.\">iPad</a> has yet to wipe out the e-readers like the Nook, though that was the popular prediction. He also reports that I.H.S. iSuppli, a research company, estimates that Barnes & Noble has 13 percent of the e-reader market after two years in the business, versus 67 percent for Amazon. </p><p> The <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/01/bn-separate-nook/\">Epicenter blog</a> noted: <blockquote>So what\u2019s the problem? Even though Nook set records, and overall retail sales for the holidays were up, sales of the Nook Simple Touch e-reader were disappointing. A price cut from $140 to $100 to match the new Kindle Touch couldn\u2019t give the six-month-old Touch enough of a boost going into the holidays. </blockquote> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/barnes-and-nobles-most-valuable-business-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-2012-1?op=1\">Business Insider</a> was highly skeptical. Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote: <blockquote>Nook\u2019s only advantage in the market is Barnes & Noble\u2019s retail: that the Nook is heavily promoted in B&N stores, and B&N still has heft in the book business to get publishing deals.</blockquote> He concluded, \u201cIn the long term, Nook is doomed. It has been a valiant effort, but Kindle economics are too powerful.\u201d</p>", "section_name": "Technology", "print_page": null, "document_type": "blogpost", "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "organization": "The New York Times"}, "web_url": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/daily-report-barnes-noble-considers-spinning-off-its-nook-unit/", "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Daily Report: Barnes & Noble Considers Spinning Off Its Nook Unit", "kicker": "Bits Blog"}, "_id": "54f31d9438f0d8529ba35ee4", "word_count": "321", "multimedia": [{"height": 400, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": "600", "xlargeheight": "400"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}, {"height": 75, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75", "thumbnailheight": "75"}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-01-06T06:22:31Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
