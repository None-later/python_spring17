AT&T <a href=\"http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/fast-windows-phones-for-atts-4g-network/\">talked about</a> new smartphones that would run on its fast 4G network, including the Titan II from HTC. And Nokia, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/technology/microsoft-defying-image-has-a-design-gem-in-windows-phone.html?pagewanted=all\">as expected</a>, unveiled the Lumia 900, Nick Wingfield reported from the show. That phone, which runs Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone operating system, represents a bid by Microsoft and Nokia to return to relevance in the smartphone market, after being marginalized by Apple and Google\u2019s Android system. <p>The initial buzz about the Lumia 900 among gadget-watchers has been positive. Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, said the company had put all of its best technology into the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s the first real Windows Phone built for and designed for the North American market,\u201d he said. The phone will also run on the AT&T 4G network and will be exclusive to AT&T in the United States.</p> <p>Our coverage of the show is on our personal tech blog, Gadgetwise.
