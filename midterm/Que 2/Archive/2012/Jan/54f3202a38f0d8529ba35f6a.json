Yahoo, one of the first Internet sensations, has been struggling. Unlike other giants on the Web, it has failed to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/technology/once-a-leader-yahoo-now-struggles-to-find-its-way.html?ref=carolbartz\">embrace social media and mobile devices</a>. And it has been losing ground over all in the critical battle for online ads. Last year Facebook overtook Yahoo in online display advertising, according to eMarketer, a research firm. Yet Yahoo has one of the largest audiences on the Web, and will report net profit of more than $1 billion in 2011 on revenue of nearly $4.44 billion, estimates Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. </p><p> Mr. Thompson, whose expertise is in technology rather than digital media or corporate turnarounds, replaces Carol A. Bartz, who was <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E1D7113AF934A3575AC0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=carolbartz\">dismissed</a> in September after a rocky two-year effort trying to turn the company around. She left with some flamboyance, announcing in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/technology/carol-bartzs-blunt-e-mail-on-firing-raises-issues.html?ref=carolbartz\">blunt e-mail blast</a> to Yahoo\u2019s 13,400 employees that she had been fired. </p><p> The appointment of Mr. Thompson was widely covered.<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1805464/what-yahoos-new-ceo-thompson-must-do-instantly-to-stop-the-rot?partner=gnews\"> Kit Eaton at Fast Company </a>and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2012/01/04/five-things-yahoos-new-ceo-scott-thompson-must-do-fast/\">Robert Hof at Forbes</a> both offered five suggestions for how the new chief executive can fix the company. Among the tips on both lists: pick a focus and don\u2019t try to be all things to all people.</p>", "section_name": "Technology", "print_page": null, "document_type": "blogpost", "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "organization": "The New York Times"}, "web_url": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/daily-report-yahoos-mr-fix-it/", "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Daily Report: Yahoo's Mr. Fix-It", "kicker": "Bits Blog"}, "_id": "54f3202a38f0d8529ba35f6a", "word_count": "237", "multimedia": [{"height": 400, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": "600", "xlargeheight": "400"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}, {"height": 75, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75", "thumbnailheight": "75"}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-01-05T08:28:49Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
