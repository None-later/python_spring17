But he writes that the changing nature of the technology industry is reflected in the fact that the most important developments are no longer coming from the show. <p>As the industry and its trade show have grown, the need for buzz and branding has become more acute. The most innovative players \u2014 like <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" class=\"tickerized\" title=\"More information about Apple Incorporated\">Apple</a> and Amazon \u2014 need to stand out from the crowd and so have chosen to introduce their products at smaller, more narrowly defined conferences and company-only events. </p> <p>The show is still important to many retailers, though, who either place orders or just get a look at new merchandise. But Apple and Amazon have brought changes to tech retailing because they sell directly to consumers.
