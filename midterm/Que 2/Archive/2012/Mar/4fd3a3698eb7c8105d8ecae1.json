Clouds of flies swarmed the dead carcasses, and the remaining lions, tigers and a brown bear were in such bad shape he wanted to shoot them to end their misery. But Mr. Anthony bought donkeys to feed the carnivores and he hunted down a stolen giraffe. (The zoo's other giraffe had been eaten by starving Iraqis.) Mr. Anthony, 61, died last week of a heart attack in Johannesburg.", "section_name": null, "print_page": null, "document_type": "blogpost", "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Mark", "role": "reported", "lastname": "MCDONALD", "rank": 1, "organization": ""}], "original": "By MARK MCDONALD"}, "web_url": "http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/lawrence-anthony-baghdad-zoo-savior-dies-at-61/", "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Lawrence Anthony, Baghdad Zoo Savior, Dies at 61", "kicker": "Rendezvous Blog"}, "_id": "4fd3a3698eb7c8105d8ecae1", "word_count": "100", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-03-12T02:44:44Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
