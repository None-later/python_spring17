Cool idea, except that the broccoli recipe struck me as wrong: \u201cOlive oil & salt, 350\u00b0 oven, 1 hour.\u201d Broccoli is a favorite in my house. During the week, I boil the florets in two inches of water, drain and add butter and salt. Sometimes, if I\u2019ve had enough sleep, I go wild and saut\u00e9 it after parboiling \u2014 this adds char and brings out sweetness. My husband can steam it with scientific precision. None of these methods take an hour; maybe 15 minutes.", "headline": {"main": "Broccoli Gone Wild", "kicker": "The 6th Floor"}, "_id": "54ee487338f0d85e5cb220d9", "word_count": "813", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2013-11-05T06:00:13Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Hamilton, Gabrielle", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Moss, Michael", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Telepan, Bill", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Waxman, Jonathan (1950- )", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Broccoli", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Cooking and Cookbooks", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Recipes", "rank": "8"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
