She has a longstanding interest in what she calls \u201cmoments of transformation\u201d in people. Her past projects have included, for example, a series of portraits of Almerisa, a Bosnian girl she has photographed every couple of years since meeting her at a refugee center in the Netherlands nearly 20 years ago, as well as Olivier, whose training as a French Foreign Legion officer she documented over several years.
