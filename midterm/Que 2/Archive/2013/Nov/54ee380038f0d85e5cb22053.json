Moukarzel\u2019s hourlong piece, which was a sold-out hit in Dublin and London for the theater company Dead Centre, aims not so much to relive Proust\u2019s epic, seven-volume story of social climbing, desire and memory as to distill its yearning, nostalgic essence into fragments of narrative and images. When the show begins, Moukarzel is running on a treadmill, his back to us, instantly conjuring images of being borne back ceaselessly into the past (or, stuck in the present). A giant diptych of Proust hangs overhead. Everywhere, there\u2019s a clutter of half-opened packing boxes, marked cheekily with labels like \u201cMum,\u201d \u201cApologies, \u201cBacon,\u201d \u201cBroken Glass\u201d and (inevitably) \u201cMadeleines.\u201d", "headline": {"main": "After Hours | An Irishman\u2019s Inner Marcel Proust", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "54ee380038f0d85e5cb22053", "word_count": "414", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2013-11-18T17:03:50Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Proust, Marcel", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "London (England)", "rank": "3"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
