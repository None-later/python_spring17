It\u2019s the work of the Brooklyn-based, largely Juilliard-trained dance-and-acrobatics ensemble Company XIV. On a proscenium framed by heavy red curtains, with candelabra where the footlights would usually be, Tchaikovsky\u2019s darling little Clara (a radiant Laura Careless) is a mini-Marie Antoinette with a comeuppance in store, to be delivered by Drosselmeyer, her godfather, played like a smarmy satyr pimp by Jeff Takacs. The genius of this production, which includes eye-dazzling physical feats performed on giant hula hoops and from silken swings, is its transformation of traditional ballet into louche vaudeville: the famous Spanish dance becomes a foot-stomping, castanet-clicking striptease; in the storied Kingdom of the Sweets, Clara wields a fat black whip to play gleeful dominatrix over a troupe of bare-bottomed, harnessed Licorice Boys.", "headline": {"main": "After Hours | An NC-17 Retelling of \u2018The Nutcracker\u2019", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "54ee201938f0d85e5cb21f80", "word_count": "314", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2013-12-09T14:00:10Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Dancing", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Minetta Lane Theater", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Greenwich Village (Manhattan, NY)", "rank": "4"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
